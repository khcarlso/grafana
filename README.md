# grafana - Grafana setup (including InfluxDB and Chronograf)

This docker-compose file sets up containers to run Grafana, InfluxDB, and Chronograf. Volumes are used for each container's application specific data so things persist across instantiations.

## Setup
Please edit the docker-compose.yaml file and modify the username and password settings for each container to suit your needs.
